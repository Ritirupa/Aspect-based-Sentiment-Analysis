# Aspect-based-Sentiment-Analysis
This project was inspired by my Text Analytics project which was "Sentiment Analysis of the Twitter dataset".I had used extracted important aspects using the top 20 unigrams and had fitted a Naive Bayes' classifier
to detect sentiments back then. Now, I moved the idea one notch up and used a new technique called "Latent Dirichlet Allocation", which is an unsupervised topic modelling technique, to extract important aspects 
from the dataset and used a LSTM to classify the sentiments based on ratings.

The code for the same is given in the .ipynb file attached above.
